# safe-courier-api-v1
Developed using data structures no databases at all

It was built using nodejs and express with a few middleware thirdparty librabries like
              - cors
              -helmet
     and some that were built from scratch to facilitate personal gains

This is a version one which lack quite alot of tools but a repo for version two be provided which contains everything a good api requires
